# Overview
Here are 2 sample files that show how we can use **typed** `react redux` and `react router` to access the feature module redux store and navigate between pages.

# Take note
For every route, make sure a "/" is added at the front. If "/" at the front is not added, the url will be appended by the destination route which will become incorrect.

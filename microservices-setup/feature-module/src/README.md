# Overview

This repo is being created as a reference to create a NPM package to share reusable code or to create a feature module for a micro-frontend application.

This feature module is technically a React application so it will be having `App.tsx` and `index.tsx` that can be use like what you have in a React application.

**(Refer to readme in `src`)**\
The exported routes in `src/index.routes.tsx` will have no any effect on the route tree in `App.tsx` so you can develop this feature module independently without the container/parent module.

# Tips
**Storybook** and **react cosmos** are two great tools for developing components. This reference will be using **react cosmos**

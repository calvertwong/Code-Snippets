# Overview

This feature module is technically a React application so it will be having `App.tsx` and `index.tsx` that can be use like what you have in a React application.

The exported routes in `src/index.routes.tsx` will have no any effect on the route tree in `App.tsx` so you can develop this feature module independently without the container/parent module.

# Tips
**Storybook** and **react cosmos** are two great tools for developing components. This reference will be using **react cosmos**.\
`src/cosmos.config.json` and `__fixtures__` are required for **react cosmos**.
